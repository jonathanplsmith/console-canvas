# console-canvas

Basic, simple, and bare-bones library for command line graphics in C.

Features
--
The library gives you a simple grid-based canvas, on which you can:
- Print text to vertically and horizontally
- Draw individual characters to the console
- Draw pretty lines
- Paste sprites

A short demo program `demo.out` is provided after executing the makefile. I might add some more features (like colour) whenever I feel like it.
