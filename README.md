# console-canvas

Basic, simple, and bare-bones library for command line graphics in C.

Features
--
The library gives you a simple grid-based canvas, on which you can:
- Print text to vertically and horizontally
- Draw individual characters to the console
- Draw pretty lines
- Paste sprites
- Do all of the above in colours of your choosing

I might add some more features whenever I feel like it.
A short demo program `demo.out` is provided after executing the makefile. Documentation for the individual functions is provided in `consoleCanvas.h`.
